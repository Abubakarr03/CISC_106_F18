Here you will find materials that were used, discussed, or created in class. 

You do not have to create an account on GitHub, but you should.

This repository will be more useful if you run the code in your own notebooks. Options:

  * Pros
    * Fast and easy -- Just click the Binder badge above
    * This will always have the lastest notebooks that I have posted for you to use
