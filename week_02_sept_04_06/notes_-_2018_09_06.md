### General Announcements:
* Lab 1 is tomorrow, quiz 1 will be assigned next week. The goal of the quiz is to cover the topics used in the lab, to make sure everyone understands the material. You have almost a full week to complete every lab, they are due Thursday night. You will have at least a few days for each quiz, they will be due when lab starts. Both are completed online through Moodle.
* I still do not have access to the quiz server.
* Topics covered in today's notebook (some of this might be moved to Thursday's lecture if we run out of time).
    * Go over the ungraded homework
    * More about lists
    * If time -- let's create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
