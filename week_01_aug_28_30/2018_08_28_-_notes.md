The programming language Python is named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, not the snake. [From the creator](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/): "I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)."

Optional: watch some of the best Monty Python sketches on Funny Or Die's [Greatest Comedy Sketches list](http://www.funnyordie.com/greatestcomedysketches). Personally I prefer The State over Monty Python, so do not despair if you're not a huge Monty Python fan.

[Dan Callahan's Keynote at PyCon 2018 starting at 6:49](https://youtu.be/ITksU31c1WY?t=409): "There's a saying in the Python community that Python is the second best language for anything. You're laughing, but that's an amazing aspiration because that aspiration says that we're not the most specialized tool but we may be the most versatile we may be the most universal. We're a tool that you can learn once and take with you if you're doing systems administration or you're doing web development or you're in education or you're in data science. Python goes everywhere, and that's incredible. And that strength is something that I think is captured in this, but I don't think that's accurate, because for one, especially if you look at the schedule for this conference this year, Python is the first best language in many domains, at least in the sciences and in education, and that's no small feat. That's decades of work from people like you sitting in this room trying to bring Python to more environments, more ecosystems, more audiences, more people. Because what's programming about, why are we programming if not to serve people, if not to solve human problems?"

[GitHub Octoverse 2017](https://octoverse.github.com/): "Python replaced Java as the second-most popular language on GitHub, with 40 percent more pull requests opened this year than last."
