# CISC 106 F18
Class files for UD's CISC 106 as taught by me

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/enactdev/CISC_106_F18/master)

Here you will find materials that were used, discussed, or created in class. 

You do not have to create an account on GitHub, but you should.

This repository will be more useful if you run the code in your own notebooks. Options:
* [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)
  * Pros
    * Fast and easy -- Just click the Binder badge above
    * This will always have the lastest notebooks that I have posted for you to use
  * Cons
    * This will not save your changes. You can play around with it, but your changes will be lost
* [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
  * Pros
    * You can pull my repository fron GitHub to run here
    * You can also create your own and save code samples
    * No need to download and install anything
  * Cons
    * Microsoft does not accept your udel.edu email for account creation, you will need to create another
    * Pulling the latest notebooks from GitHub is not trivial. If this is a popular option I will create a quick guide
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) -- Download and run notebooks on your own machine
  * Pros
  * Cons
    * This is by far the hardest option, but also the most rewarding once you are done. 
    * There is no offical support from teachers or TAs for this option. There are plenty of guides online, and you can ask fellow students for help.
  * Guides:
    * [Offical install guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
    * [Getting started guide from the CodingTheSmartWay.com Blog](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)

A hybrid approach is probably best. You can always quickly run my latest code by clicking the Binder badge, and either use Azure or your own Anaconda instance to create and store notebooks that you created to reference in the future.
